            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control system, also known as Revision Control or Source Control Management, is the main repository (or storage) for project files. These files are then able to be accessed by numerous people allowing them to change them and put them back into the repository. Not only that but it allows for people with access to the file to see who changed it and what was changed. This topic is relevant to the course because the sharing of files allows for ease when working separately, as well as being able to show what you’ve done.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is shared amongst coworkers on a separate server, allowing for people to get files from it.  While a local repository is used by an individual on a local machine, which they are the only one to have access to it. It is important to understand the difference to allow for an understanding when which one could possibly be used or when you’d want to use one over the other. It’s interesting because although there are two different repositories people don’t typical see or even have knowledge about either. I’d say a lot of people don’t even know they exist. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git stores information from files for every change made. The information gets stored in directories. Commits knows the information about what happens in the directories; like the information of the committer as well as the time it was accessed. When changes are made a new commit is formed. Behind the commits is the default name, then the head which shows your last commit. Git commands are used for many different tasks such as creating a new local repository or adding files, but there are any more tasks. Gits help keep things organized. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two options for obtaining a Git project, you can either take import an existing directory into a Git or you can clone it from another server. By typing the right command you are able to create a subdirectory that contains repository files, but it hasn’t tracked the project yet. You must enter more commands in order to begin tracking the files. If you go to clone an existing repository, you have to use a command with “clone” instead of “checkout”. Git repositories are important because they make things easier.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three basic steps; 1) Add 2) Commit 3) Push. Although Git is slightly more complicated than add, commit, push this three steps allow for a good starting point and are easy to follow. Its interesting to me because out of something that seems that it could get a little complicated can be broken down into the basics that almost any one could follow. These steps are important because they are the main aspects used in Git.</p>
